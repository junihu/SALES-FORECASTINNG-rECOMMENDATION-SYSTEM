Framework: Python (Flask)

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that is well-suited for developing web applications quickly and efficiently. It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and is designed to be simple yet extensible, allowing developers to add extensions and libraries as needed.

Key Features of Flask:

Minimalistic: Flask provides the essential tools and features to get a web application up and running without unnecessary bloat, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects.

Flexible: Flask does not impose any specific project structure, giving developers the freedom to organize their code in a way that best suits their project.

Extensible: Flask's modular design allows for easy integration of third-party libraries and extensions, such as database connectors, form validation tools, and authentication mechanisms.

Built-in Development Server: Flask includes a built-in server for testing and debugging applications during the development process, streamlining the workflow for developers.

Jinja2 Templating Engine: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, enabling developers to create dynamic HTML pages with ease.

RESTful Request Handling: Flask provides robust support for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs, making it a popular choice for developing backend services.
